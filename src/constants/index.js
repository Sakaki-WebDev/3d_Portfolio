I worked with ASANA, and learned how to manange with larger projects and being assigned tasks left right and centre.But ASANA made it alot easier and clearer. I worked on websites such as https://www.embassygardens.com . This is a website for a new community that was built around the US embassy, for a company called Ballymore, a very big property developer in London. Its a very sophisticated website that required a huge amount of testing, text and image optimisation and upload via the CMS.Working with FIGMA, i followed the designers storyboards and mock ups, and added the data accordingly. This required learning figma and i worked with the lead designer, learning how to use figma. Another big website was https://www.riverscape.co.uk/ . Another website for Ballymore. After graduating from my web development degree, i took an intership offer at Azulstudio for 12 months as a junior web developer. Shadowing senior web devs, I learned alot about their tech stack and how they built the websites. I started to utlise Nuxt and Vue JS and how to attach them to a headless wordpress cms, so that the data added through the wordpress backend shows on the front end. The tech stack included Nuxtjs, Tailwind CSS, Vue.JS, Figma and Wordpress.  ',
